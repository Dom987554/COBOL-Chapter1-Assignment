# CALC2000 (COBOL) - Future Value Investment Calculator
A small Cobol program taht calculates the future value of an investment using a fixed annual interest rate over a fixed number of years. After the first calculation, it doubles the investment amount twice, recalculating the future value each time (so you get three future-value results total).
***
## What it does
For each run, the program:
  1. Calculates the future value for the initial investment.
  2. Doubles the investment amount and calculates again.
  3. Doubles the investment amount again and calculates a third time.

The future value is cimputed iteratively (year-by-year) as:
